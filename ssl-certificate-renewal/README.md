## in Chrome

to inspect a certificate, in chrome open the dev tools, then the security tab, there's a button "*inspect certificate*"

## the details

### who (the provider)

changes all the time; to get the current version:

* go to `helpdesk.inria.fr`
* find the section "***Demande de certificat de service***"
* make sure to have the VPN enabled if needed
* click "***Documentation en ligne***"

### duration

used to be 3 years IIRC at some point, then 2 years, and in 2021 now 1 year; next time 6 months ?

***

## early 2023: r2lab-sidecar

### the need

for robustness and firewall traversals, we want to move the sidecar service

* from r2lab.inria.fr:999
* to r2lab-sidecar.inria.fr:443

which leads to the new requirement for a certificate that validates this DNS name

### the CSR (and key)

```shell
cd 2023-early/r2lab-sidecar
SERVICE_NAME=r2lab-sidecar.inria.fr
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout $SERVICE_NAME.key -out $SERVICE_NAME.csr -nodes -sha256 -subj "/CN=$SERVICE_NAME"
```

### the format

the target app that uses the certificate is our Python `sidecar-server.py`
the format to use for installing the cert should be the same as for nginx, since before this move we were using the same cert for both the official website at `r2lab.inria.fr` and for the websockets service on 999

### the list

| hostname | dest. email | status | comment |
|----------|-------------|---|---------|
| `r2lab.inria.fr`            | fit-r2lab-dev@inria.fr  | <span class=green>oct 14 2023</span> | alternate-name `fit-r2lab.inria.fr` <br> ***nginx-based***
| `r2labapi.inria.fr`         | fit-r2lab-dev@inria.fr  | <span class=green>oct 14 2023</span> | first form (certificate in pem format) <br>3 files `.crt` in `/etc/planetlab` to change identically
| `nepi-ng.inria.fr`          | fit-r2lab-dev@inria.fr  | <span class=green>oct 14 2023</span> | ***nginx-based***
| `sopnode-registry.inria.fr` | fit-r2lab-dev@inria.fr  | <span class=green>oct 14 2023</span> | bundle pem needed; not a PKCS#7, not an intermediate
| `nbhosting.inria.fr`        | nbhosting@inria.fr      | <span class=green>oct 14 2023</span> | ***nginx-based*** (see note)
| `nbhosting-dev.inria.fr`    | nbhosting@inria.fr      | <span class=green>oct 14 2023</span> | ***nginx-based*** (see note)
|

for ***nginx-based sites***, among the formats available in the mail, I pick
> "***as Certificate (w/ issuer after), PEM encoded***"

which is the second one

### the `fit-r2lab.inria.fr` case

formerly with apache it was simple : one certificate per hostname; now with `nginx`, the same approach
requires to create one server per hostname, with all the attached settings duplicated

so it seems to be time to play with SAN (server alternate name) csr requests

* the new `csr` was generated in `fit+r2lab-csr/` using this command

  ```bash
  openssl req -config fit+r2lab.conf -new -sha256 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout fit+r2lab.key -out fit+r2lab.csr -nodes
  ```

* the old `csr` files are renamed into `.obso` and moved in the `2021/` folder

### NOTE (the accident)

about `sopnode-registry.inria.fr`
* I made a first request valid up to Sept. 26 2023
* stored in folder `2022/sopnode-registry-v0`
* ***together with the key***
* however I did not have time to deploy it yet, so let us have all them in sync
* which means, throw that one away and ask for a new one

***

## 2021

## notes for next time

* the csr files under `git/r2lab-misc/ssl-certificate-digicert` are from 2017 but were
  usable as-is in 2019 and 2021, worth keeping them

* reinstallation is rather straightforward but must be done manually on each box,
  depending on the running setup; in particular `r2labapi` has this installed in
  `/etc/planetlab` as the cert for the api and www subsystems.

## where to install

see https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate-installation-nginx.htm

| host | which | where | status |
|------|-------|-------|--|
| nbhosting     | nbhosting     | /root/ssl-certificate/bundle.crt          | OK
| nbhosting     | nbhosting-dev | /root/ssl-certificate-dev/bundle.crt      | OK
| nbhosting-dev | nbhosting     | /root/ssl-certificate/bundle.crt          | OK
| nbhosting-dev | nbhosting-dev | /root/ssl-certificate-dev/bundle.crt      | OK
| r2lab         | r2lab         | /etc/pki/tls/certs/r2lab_inria_fr.crt     | OK
| r2lab         | fit-r2lab     | /etc/pki/tls/certs/fit-r2lab_inria_fr.crt | OK
| r2lab         | nepi-ng       | /etc/pki/tls/certs/nepi-ng_inria_fr.crt   | OK
| r2labapi     | r2labapi_inria_fr.crt        | /etc/planetlab/api_ssl.crt    | KO-KO-KO
| r2labapi     | r2labapi_inria_fr.crt        | /etc/planetlab/www_ssl.crt    | KO-KO-KO
| r2labapi     | r2labapi_inria_interm_fr.crt | /etc/planetlab/api_ca_ssl.crt | KO-KO-KO
| r2labapi     | r2labapi_inria_interm_fr.crt | /etc/planetlab/www_ca_ssl.crt | KO-KO-KO


### notes
* for the nginx and apache setups, the installation is simple
* on the PLC front on the other hand
  * it's easy to have the startup script break it all under your feet
  * so **before restarting** the plc service
    it's safer to run something like (that's what `/etc/plc,d/httpd` does)

    ```shell
    cd /etc/planetlab
    openssl verify -CAfile api_ca_ssl.crt api_ssl.crt
    openssl verify -CAfile www_ca_ssl.crt www_ssl.crt
    ```

    which should return OK
